We are third year students from University of Toronto. Since I just created this profile, we'll be coming back to update it

##About Us

We are a bunch of computer engineers, who have been trained in core back-end battles all our univerity lives. Apart from very basic web development knowledge, we barely know anything in this realm of knowledge. But here we are, on this fine weekend, to shed our tears and blood to learn and participate in such a great event showcasing our beginner level website.
